=============
Junior Developer with a curiosity & passion for code. High respect for best practices and thorough test-driven development.

I work well in teams drawing from my experiences living in multiple, culturally diverse continents and I enjoy opportunities to pair program and work in teams with developers from different backgrounds.

I'm looking for a creative environment in which I can contribute my skills and knowledge to a driven team in order to accomplish any task while continuing to grow as a software developer.

James Borrell
=============
I am a curious and passionate junior developer based in London, UK.

I work well in teams drawing from my experiences living in multiple continents abroad and I enjoy opportunities to pair program with developers from different backgrounds.

I'm looking for a creative environment in which I can contribute my skills and knowledge to a driven team in order to accomplish any task while continuing to grow as a software developer.
